# Bitrise

- will auto-add SSH keys, alternatively can provide your own
- asks about additional private repos, "For example for private CocoaPods, fastlane match, submodule, etc."
- free 2 week "Team" level trial
- `VALIDATING REPOSITORY` step is slow (to be fair, they do say "this may take a few minutes"). But it did detect and generate a config based off of:
   - package.json
   - Podfile
       - interestingly, it found the Podfile but didn't generate a step to install pods
   - iOS project
       - even noted that it wasn't setup as a shared scheme (a mistake on my part)
   - fastlane (all 3 lanes)
  - gradlew
- auto-register webhook
- slick web editor for steps
- instant message chat: >Hi Alex, Oh, snap! Looks like your builds keep failing.
- clicking on a build will show the diff of the build's bitrise config vs the current one
- UI can be clunky at times (try scrolling when using one of the modals)
- no combined iOS & Android stack: https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/xcode-android-sdk-combined-stack/242/2
    - suggestion for now is two builds :(
- bitrise CLI is pretty neat, it was useful while doing some debugging
- iOS build took ~9 minutes (no caching in place)
- [Can only have one workflow per trigger](https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/how-to-trigger-multiple-workflows-at-the-same-time/3401).
    - This is a pain point since it's not possible to do an Android build on iOS without using the Xamarin stack.
